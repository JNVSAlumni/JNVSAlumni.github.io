    <h5>Career as a mathematician</h5>

    <h6>Motivation</h6>
    <p>
        How do you convert written words into maths ? Goldman says, it takes a combination of algebra and geometry. Imagine an object
        floating in space that has an edge for every known scrap of information. It's called a polytopes and it has near-infinite
        dimensions, almost impossible to conjure up in our earthbound minds.<br /> The world is moving into a new
        age of numbers. Partnerships between mathematicians and computer scientists are bulling into whole new domains of
        business and imposing the efficiencies of maths. This has happened before. In past decades, the marriage of higher
        math and computer modelling transformed science and engineering. Quants turned finance upside down a generation ago.
        And data miners plucked useful nuggets from vast consumer and business databases. But, just look at where the mathematicians
        are now. They're helping to map out advertising campaigns, they're changing the nature of research in newsrooms and
        in biology labs, and they're enabling marketers to forge new one-on-one relationships with customers. As this occurs,
        more of the economy falls into the realm of numbers. Says James R. Schatz, chief of the mathematics research group
        at the National Security Agency: "There has never been a better time to be a mathematician."<br /> The rise of mathematics
        is heating up the job market for luminary quants, especially at the Internet powerhouses where new math graduates
        land with six-figure salaries and rich stock deals. Tom Leighton, an entrepreneur and applied math professor at Massachusetts
        Institute of Technology, says: "All of my students have standing offers at Yahoo and Google. Top mathematicians are
        becoming new global elite. It's a force of barely 5,000, by some guesstimates, but every bit as powerful as the armies
        of Harvard University MBA's who shook up corner suites a generation ago.

    <h6>Mathematics Olympiad</h6>
    <p>
        Here is the website of an NGO (Science Olympiad Foundation) devoted to promotion of school education in India. They organize
        Mathematics Olympiad starting from class 2 to class 12. The official mathematical Olympiad is organized by NBHM (National
        Board of Higher Mathematics) which included syllabus from class 9 to class 12 (NCERT) with sophisticated complications
        in problems requiring smart application of concepts.

    <h6>Mathematics as a subject</h6>
    <p>
        Math can be described as the language of science. Any research industry cannot function without a mathematical expert in
        its research team. Basically, maths based career can be divided in two broad categories.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pure mathematicians</li>
        <li>Applied mathematicians</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Pure mathematics consists of abstract topics from core mathematical field. It includes Algebra, Analysis, Geometry (Algebraic,
        Differential), Topology, Representation Theory, Quantum Mechanics, Partial Differential Equations, String Theory
        etc. These domain of mathematical fields are used in solving higher level problems from arising from other areas
        of scientific studies like Physics, Computer Science, Chemistry. Some problems and their relevance is day-to-day
        life are so complex that it cannot be explained to an undergraduate student.<br /> Applied mathematics deals
        with day to day problem faced by computer scientists, biotechnologist, demographer, economists, chemists and physicists.
        These fields covers Linear Algebra, Analysis, Differential Equations, Graph Theory, Probability Theory and Stochastic
        Processes.
    </p>

    <h6>Statistics can be another option :</h6>
    <p>
        A slightly different field of applied area is known as Statistics. It involves understanding a population by analyzing a
        small sample(part of population). It is comparatively new field in comparison to mathematics broadly developed by
        researchers from different domain. Statisticians are highly valued in the job market and get handsome salary as compensation.
    </p>
    <h6>Future scopes</h6>
    <p>
        If you want a satisfying research career with sixth sense analytical skill, go for pure mathematics. We want to make you
        cautious at this point that it’s a comparatively difficult field than other scientific domain and harder to understand.
        If you have great motivation to do mathematics and establish yourself as a researcher, go for it. <br />        Second one is relatively easier and has a great demand in market. If you want to earn money as much as an MBA, go
        for second one. You can do higher studies in various fields Physics, Economics and Computer science apart from core
        mathematics and statistics. You can also join job market right after your Bachelor or Masters.
    </p>

    <h6>Workload</h6>
    <p>
        It is more intense and needs your attention than an engineering course. Many students who left their engineering and joined
        such programs in past; has confirmed that it is more demanding than their previous engineering courses.
    </p>

    <h6>Indian Institute providing quality education in this area</h6>
    <p>
        Here are some institutes which can be an ideal starting place for your mathematical career. Interestingly, most of them provide
        adequate scholarships, so financing your Bachelor/master's education will not be a burden to your parents. They organize
        entrace test which can be tracked through major national daily or directly from their website.
